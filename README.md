# where-are-we

A multiplayer Game implemented by using HTML,CSS , Bootstrap , Firebase ( databse ) , javascript,JQUERY , Google MAPS API , Yoda Api for the chat , this is a Team project that i enjoyed working with my teammates 

it's a fun game  inspired from Geocode , it shows you a carousel of a place and you need to figure out which place is that 
the closer to the answer the more chances of a win
